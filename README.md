# OpenCV and Mediapipe hand Gesture Research Modules

This repository contains python scripts for various modules we found and developed on hand gesture recognition and interaction using OpenCV and Mediapipe. These modules provide a foundation for exploring various techniques and algorithms for hand gesture detection, tracking, and interacion in computer vision applications

## Modules
- **Finger Count**
- **Finger Tracker with disappearing trajectory**
- **Finger Tracker with trajectory storage** 
- **Finger Tracker with color change (Base AirCanvas)**
- **Air Canvas**
- **Gesture based computer interaction (Scrolling and Sliding)**

## Features
- **Real-time Hand Landmark Detection:** Utilized Mediapipe to detect hand landmarks in real-time from webcam feed.
- **Gesture Recognition:** Includes modules for recognizing and interpreting hand gestures based on detected landmarks.
- **Hand Trajectory Tracking:** Provides functionality for tracking hand trajectories and analyzing movement patterns.
- **Interactive User Interface:** Offers interactive interfaces for tool selection and visual feedback.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**
- **OpenCV**
- **Mediapipe**

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to you local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hand-gesture-research.git
```
2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe
```

## Usage
1. Explore the individual modules to understand their functionalities and purposes.
